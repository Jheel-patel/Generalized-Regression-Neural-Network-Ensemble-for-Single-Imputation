# Generalized-Regression-Neural-Network-Ensemble-for-Single-Imputation

This project is developed to impute a missing data from data sets. This project was developed as a part of Data Mining Course. Real life data sets were used for comparison. A dummy data set which had incomplete data set was fed to this project. The incomplete and complete data sets were then divided and completed data sets were used to train the GRNN and then that model was used to impute the missing data. The NRMS was calculated by comparing the imputed data sets with the actual data sets.
